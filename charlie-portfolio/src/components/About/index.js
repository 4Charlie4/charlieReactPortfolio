          I am a Full Stack Developer based in Orlando, Fl. I love anything tech
          and dream of a future where technology will push us to new heights.
          <br></br>Now I can be apart of something like that. Developing
          software whether it is websites, simulations, or AI, and more! I'd
          love to challenge myself with all of it. <br></br>
          <br></br>I have many projects that I have been working on with a
          variety of different tools such as the MERN stack. I've utilized the
          MVC design paradigm, <br></br> worked with databases such as mySql,
          MongoDB, and IndexedDB. I am proficient in Javascript and can use it
          in a variety of ways including
          <br></br> FrontEnd, Object Oriented Programming, NodeJs, ES5, and ES6.

          <br></br>
          <br></br>I am transitioning from a background in the restaurant
          industry from which I leverage a number of skills from. The important
          ones being<br></br> The ability to collaborate with teams,
          communication, grit, and adaptability. I have all kinds of people even
          from places around the world.<br></br> I can connect with anyone and
          love meeting new people whether it is a team or client.<br></br>
          <br></br> Back to a little bit more about me. I originally studied to
          be a kinesiologist, so naturally I love working out. But I love combat
          sports even more.<br></br>I am a Muay Thai fighter and wrestler at
          heart. I hope to train jiu jitsu soon and mix it together with some
          MMA (Maybe there is a role out<br></br> there for a Web
          Developer/Security ). I am also a huge nerd and love playing video
          games, my favorite right now being Elden Ring.<br></br>
          If it wasn't obvious I love a Challenge whether it is a jumping into a
          new career and learning a difficult skill such as programming,
          <br></br> or training to fight, or playing a game. <br></br>
          <br></br>Thanks for Checking out my website! Take a look at my
          projects, or my socials. Any feedback in general would be greatly
          appreciated so do reach out. I look forward to joining your team!
